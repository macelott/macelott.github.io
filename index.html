    <p>Throughout the CS3041(HCI) course I have learned about the design process and what it entails. As an aspiring software engineer, the only thing I had ever known was satisfying requirements. Furthermore, I am not a creative person, but following the design process, I was able design things that I could not have otherwise. The following is the top 5 steps I emphasize and use the most during the design process.<br><br>

The first is <strong>brainstorming</strong>; keep throwing ideas at the wall no matter if they stick or not. Before taking the HCI course, I would reserve a lot of ideas during brainstorming to myself because I did not deem them worthy to be considered by others. Now, I go for quantity instead of quality of the ideas (as suggested here: <a href="https://kixlab.org/courses/cs374-spring-2017/classes/08-Ideation/)">Ideation</a>) because ideas will be filtered anyways, so why not generate more of them? Moreover, a bunch of ideas gives me more things to work with and possibly more alternatives to create when it comes to sketching and prototyping.<br><br>

The second is <strong>sketching</strong>; draw like there is no tomorrow. At first, I didn't see the point of sketching if I could just create a beautiful prototype using software without needing to draw. I learned throughout my assignments that prototyping right away is not a good idea because it is time and resource intensive. As with ideas, churning out multiple sketches can be very helpful, especially when you can materialize an idea quickly. Additionally, it is very helpful to see the brainstormed ideas visually so one can mix and match features.

This is the final sketch I made after incorporating many ideas from numerous sketches in the Design for Others assignment.
<br><br>

The third is <strong>prototyping</strong>; make prototypes*. I supported the idea of prototyping from the get-go. However, now I am more careful of when I start prototyping. Performing this step right after ideation/brainstorming isn't ideal as discussed before. It is optimal to draft a final sketch before moving on to prototyping. Throughout the course, I was able to explore many prototyping tools. I even used Microsoft Powerpoint for the Design for Others assignment!

The prototype shown above was made using Powerpoint. It is extremely similar to the final sketch I made further up.

The fourth is <strong>user testing</strong>; test, test, test! Demo days are usually when most teams do their first user test. They are very exciting because you can see users react to what you have worked on. I learned that depending on what you want out of the user test, most of the time it is best to not inform the user about the features and/or how to use the product. It was extremely important for me to learn to be an observer and less of a coach when performing user tests. Something inside me always wanted to guide the user, but what is the point of testing if I'm telling the user everything they need to know? Thankfully, I can now successfully control myself and perform successful user tests... most of the times.<br><br>

The fifth is <strong>feedback evaluation</strong>; listen to feedback. In previous academic projects, I found myself struggling to take criticism for my work because I couldn't put away my bias and ego. However, taking this course has made me more proficient at turning feedback into valuable advice. The "I like..., I wish..., What if" format definitely made it easier to evaluate feedback. This step is essential to master because it basically decides if the product needs another iteration of prototyping, testing, and evaluation. The design document we had to write for every assignment was extremely useful to formulate our reflection on the feedback we received.<br><br>

These five steps in the design process are what I leaned on the most when I carried out the design process. I didn't start out using them efficiently or even liking some of them, but in the end they are essential to the design process and must be executed well in order to design something good. This course has sparked my interest for design and I will keep using what I learn to make better designs and user experiences.<br><br></p>
